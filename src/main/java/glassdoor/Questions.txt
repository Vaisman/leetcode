- The question is to find the number of connected components for an input of double linked list.

- Given an input of cycled double linked list, please describe an algorithm to find the number of connected components.

- There is a garden with N slots. In each slot, there is a flower. The N flowers will bloom one by one in N days.
  In each day, there will be exactly one flower blooming and it will be in the status of blooming since then.
  Given an array flowers consists of number from 1 to N. Each number in the array represents the place where the flower
  will open in that day.
  For example, flowers[i] = x means that the unique flower that blooms at day i will be at position x, where i and
  x will be in the range from 1 to N.
  Also given an integer k, you need to output in which day there exists two flowers in the status of blooming,
  and also the number of flowers between them is k and these flowers are not blooming.
  If there isn’t such day, output -1.

- Given a time represented in the format "HH:MM",
  form the next closest time by reusing the current digits.
  There is no limit on how many times a digit can be reused.

  You may assume the given input string is always valid.
  For example, "01:34", "12:09" are all valid. "1:34", "12:9" are all invalid.

  Example 1:

  Input: "19:34"
  Output: "19:39"
  Explanation: The next closest time choosing from digits 1, 9, 3, 4, is 19:39, which occurs 5 minutes later.
  It is not 19:33, because this occurs 23 hours and 59 minutes later.

  Example 2:

  Input: "23:59"
  Output: "22:22"
  Explanation: The next closest time choosing from digits 2, 3, 5, 9, is 22:22.
  It may be assumed that the returned time is next day's time since it is smaller than the input time numerically.
